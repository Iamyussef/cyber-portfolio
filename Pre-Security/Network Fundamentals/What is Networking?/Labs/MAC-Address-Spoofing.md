# MAC Address Spoofing Activity Write-Up (TryHackMe)

**Completed**: August 27, 2025, 04:23 PM +01  
**Skills**: MAC address spoofing, network security  

## What I Learned
Learned to spoof Bob’s MAC address (00:12:32:2F:33:39) to match Alice’s, showing how hackers can mimic devices to bypass network controls.

## Objective
Practice spoofing Bob’s MAC to Alice’s to understand how it tricks networks and highlights security risks.

## My Approach
Checked the diagram, noted Alice and Bob’s MACs, and used the tool to change Bob’s MAC to Alice’s. Tested with “Request Site” to see if it worked—cool trick!
