## Ping Tool in TryHackMe

**Objective:**  
Test connectivity to a remote server using the ping tool.

**Description:**  
I utilized the ping tool in TryHackMe to test connectivity to a remote server (`8.8.8.8`). By sending ICMP packets, I confirmed the server was reachable and measured the response times. This exercise helped me understand basic network troubleshooting and how to verify server availability in real-time.
