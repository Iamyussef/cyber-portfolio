#  What I Learned: Networking  

In this room, I was introduced to the **concept of networking**, which is simply a *connection between at least two nodes or devices.  

##  Understanding the Internet  
As I dug deeper, the idea of the **Internet** started to make much more sense — it’s basically a **giant network of many local networks** all interconnected together.  

##  Device Identification  
I then explored how devices identify themselves inside a network. This is where the concepts of:  
- **IP addresses** (with the differences between *IPv4* and *IPv6*)  
- **MAC addresses**  

came into play.  

##  Hands-On Practice  
What I really enjoyed was getting my *hands dirty* with some practical tasks:  
- I experimented with **MAC address spoofing** (faking a device’s MAC address).  
- I also used the `ping` command to check the performance and connectivity between my device and a virtual server.

 Overall, this room gave me a solid foundation in networking — both the *theory* and the *practice* — and it made the bigger picture of how the Internet works feel a lot clearer.
