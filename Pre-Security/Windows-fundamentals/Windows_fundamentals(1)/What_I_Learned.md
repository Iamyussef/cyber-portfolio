# Windows Fundamentals 1 – Learning Report  
Platform: TryHackMe

I completed the Windows Fundamentals 1 room on TryHackMe as part of my introduction to understanding how Windows works from a technical point of view. Before this room, I was familiar with Windows only as a user. I used it every day, but I did not really think about what happens behind the scenes.

One of the first things I noticed was how Windows is organized. The room explained basic parts like the Desktop, Start Menu, Taskbar, and File Explorer. These are things I normally use without thinking, but learning their actual role helped me understand why Windows is designed the way it is and how users interact with the system.

I also learned about how files and folders are stored. The explanation of folders such as `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`, and `C:\Users` made things clearer for me. I understood that system files are kept separate from personal files to avoid problems and to protect the operating system from being damaged easily.

Another important part of the room was user accounts. I learned the difference between administrator and standard users and why not everyone should have full access to the system. This helped me understand how permissions are used to reduce risks and keep the system secure, especially when more than one person uses the same computer.

The room also introduced some system tools like the Control Panel and system configuration options. These tools allow users to change settings, manage programs, and control how the system starts. I realized how useful these tools are for fixing issues or managing a computer properly.

Finally, the room talked about Windows security. I learned about Windows Defender, the firewall, and the importance of updates. This part showed me that Windows already includes basic security features, but they only work well if they are correctly configured and kept up to date.

In general, Windows Fundamentals 1 was a good starting point for me. It did not feel too difficult, but it helped me understand Windows in a more technical way. This room gave me a base that I can build on as I continue learning about IT and cybersecurity.
