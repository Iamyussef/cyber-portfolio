# **TryHackMe Labs – Progress Report**

Through the TryHackMe labs, I continued expanding my knowledge of Linux and its command-line tools. I worked with commands like **`grep`**, **`wc`**, and **`cat`**, which helped me understand how to explore and analyze files more efficiently.

I used **`cat`** to *inspect file contents*, and **`wc`** to check the *number of lines, words, and characters* inside a file. These simple tools gave me clearer insight into how text files are structured at a deeper level.

The **`grep`** command became especially useful when searching for *specific patterns or keywords* inside large files—something that would be nearly impossible to do manually.

I also practiced using the **`find`** command, which turned out to be incredibly helpful when navigating *large, intimidating directory structures* and locating files quickly.

Overall, these labs strengthened my command-line skills and made working inside a Linux environment feel far more natural and manageable.
