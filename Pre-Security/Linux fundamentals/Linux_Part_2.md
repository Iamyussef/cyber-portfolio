Linux Fundamentals – Part 2 -TryHackMe

I worked through a Linux fundamentals room on TryHackMe that was mostly theory, but very useful. I learned how to connect to a Linux machine using SSH, and how to make commands more powerful using flags and switches, as well as checking the man pages when I wasn’t sure. I also practiced navigating the filesystem, looking at file permissions, and switching between users. One part I really liked was going over the main directories in Ubuntu, like /etc and /var, and understanding what kind of data is stored there and how it can be useful. Overall, it gave me a clearer picture of Linux and how the system works.
