Linux Basics – TryHackMe Room Report

Exploring this TryHackMe room was my first real dive into the Linux ecosystem. It walked me through the origins of Linux in the early 1990s and showed me how it grew into one of the most influential operating systems out there. What I found especially interesting is how almost every modern system carries a bit of Linux’s spirit—its structure, its philosophy, or the tools it inspired.

What I Worked On

I spent a good amount of time getting used to the terminal and practicing the commands that form the backbone of everyday Linux usage:

cd

pwd

echo

cat

echo > and echo >>

I also got introduced to useful operators like & for launching background processes and && for chaining commands. These helped me see how efficient the terminal can be once you understand its logic.

Takeaways

This room gave me a strong starting point. I’m now more confident navigating Linux, handling files, and understanding how commands interact. It was a simple introduction, but it opened the door to a much bigger world in cybersecurity—and it made me excited to keep going.
